# Illustrated Web Algorithm

Web is unique when it comes to common algorithm. Since it has different programming paradigm like callback, closure and setTimeout.

When those mixed together the algorithm becomes hard to understand even with a few lines of code.

It is the web algorithm that makes new comer scratching head.

So I try to illustrate those web algorithm in visual style.

Enjoy it.
